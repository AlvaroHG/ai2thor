* Graphics Card: DX9 (shader model 3.0) or DX11 with feature level 9.3 capabilities.
* CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
* Python 2.7 or Python 3.5+
* Linux: X server with GLX module enabled

## Concepts

* **Agent:** A capsule shaped entity that can navigate within scenes and interact with objects.

* **Scene:** A scene within AI2-THOR represents a virtual room that an agent can navigate in and interact with. There are 4 scene Categories, each with 30 unique Scenes within them: **Kitchen, Living Room, Bedroom, Bathroom**.

* **Action:** A discrete command for the Agent to perform within a scene (e.g. MoveAhead, RotateRight, PickupObject)

* **Sim Object:** Objects that can be interacted with by the Agent. Please refer to [the Sim Object Info Table Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wx8vWgmFSi-4Gknkwl2fUMG8oRedu-tUklGSvU0oh4U/edit?usp=sharing) and check the **Object Locations** sheet to see which Object types can be found in which Scene Category. Note that objects marked **_All_** are guaranteed to be found in all scenes of a given Category, objects marked **_Some_** can be found in some but not all scenes of a given Category, and objects marked **_None_** will not be found in a scene of the given Category.

* **Object Visibility:** An object is considered Visible when it satisfies three conditions: It must be within the Camera's viewport, it must be within a threshold of distance from the Agent's center (1.5 meters), and a ray emitted from the camera must hit the object without first hitting another obstruction. Note that an object rendered in an image will not always be Visible to the Agent. For example, an object outside the 1.5 meter threshold could be seen in an image, but will be reported as not-visible to the Agent.

* **Object Interactability:** An object is said to be interactable if it is flagged as Visible and if it is unobstructed by any other objects. Most objects will be Interactable as long as they are also Visible, but some objects have transparency which can cause objects to be reported as "visible" through them. An example is a Glass Shower Door with a Sponge object behind it. The glass door will be flagged as Visible and Interactable, but the sponge will only be Visible. Attempting to interact with the sponge will throw an error as it can't be reached through the glass door, only seen.


* **Receptacle:** A type of object that can contain another object. Some examples of receptacles are: TableTop, Cup, Sofa, Bed, Desk, Bowl, etc. Some Receptacles cannot be moved within the scene, and are mostly large objects that don't make sense to move (Countertop, Sink, etc). Some Receptacles can also open and close (Microwave, Cabinet, Drawer, etc) while others can also be picked up and moved around by the Agent (Plate, Bowl, Box, etc.).

## PIP Installation

```bash
pip install ai2thor
```
Once installed you can launch the framework. **Make sure X server with OpenGL extensions is running before running the following commands. You can check by running ```glxinfo``` or ```glxgears```.**

```python
import ai2thor.controller
controller = ai2thor.controller.Controller()
controller.start()

# Kitchens:       FloorPlan1 - FloorPlan30
# Living rooms:   FloorPlan201 - FloorPlan230
# Bedrooms:       FloorPlan301 - FloorPlan330
# Bathrooms:      FloorPLan401 - FloorPlan430
controller.reset('FloorPlan28')

# gridSize specifies the coarseness of the grid that the agent navigates on
controller.step(dict(action='Initialize', gridSize=0.25))
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveAhead'))
```
Upon executing the ```controller.start()``` a window should appear on screen with a view of the room FloorPlan28.

## Event/Metadata
Each call to ```controller.step()``` returns an instance of an Event.  Detailed descriptions of each field can be found within the [tutorial](http://ai2thor.allenai.org/tutorials/event-metadata).  The Event object contains a screen capture from the point the last action completed as well as metadata about each object within the scene.

```python
event = controller.step(dict(action=MoveAhead))

# Numpy Array - shape (width, height, channels), channels are in RGB order
event.frame

# byte[] PNG image
event.image

# current metadata dictionary that includes the state of the scene
event.metadata
```

## Actions

We currently provide the following API controlled actions. Actions are defined in ```unity/Assets/Scripts/PhysicsRemoteFPSAgentController.cs```. 

### Object Position Randomization

After initializing the scene, pickupable objects can have their default positions randomized to any valid receptacle they could be placed in within the scene. Pass an int of your choice into `randomSeed` to seed the randomization. Setting `forceVisible = true` will attempt to spawn objects outside of openable receptacles (ie: if you wanted no objects to spawn in Cabinets or Drawers and only in outside, immediately visible receptacles). Finally, setting `maxNumRepeats` to higher values will improve position spawn accuracy by attempting to spawn objects in more locations, but this will be at the cost of performance. Setting it to `5` as a starting point is a good default.

```python
event = controller.reset('FloorPlan28')
event = controller.step(dict(action='Initialize', gridSize=0.25))
event = controller.step(dict(action = 'InitialRandomSpawn', randomSeed = 0, forceVisible = false, maxNumRepeats = 5))
```
Remember to reset and initiialize the scene before using the Position Randomizer, otherwise seeded values will be innacurate. 

### Agent Movement and Orientation

When moving or rotating the agent, do note that if the agent is holding a Sim Object in its hand it could prevent moving or turning from succeeding. This is to prevent held objects from clipping with the environment.

#### RotateRight
Rotate the agent by 90 degrees to the right of its current facing
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='RotateRight'))
```
#### RotateLeft
Rotate the agent by 90 degrees to the left of its current facing
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='RotateLeft'))
```
#### LookUp
Angle the agent's view up in 30 degree increments (max upward angle is 30 degrees above the forward horizon)
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='LookUp'))
```
#### LookDown
Angle the agent's view down in 30 degree increments (max downward angle is 60 degrees below the forward horizon)
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='LookDown'))
```
#### MoveAhead
Move the agent forward by `gridSize`.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveAhead'))
```
#### MoveRight
Move the agent right by `gridSize` (without changing view direction).
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveRight'))
```
#### MoveLeft
Move the agent left by `gridSize` (without changing view direction).
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveLeft'))
```
#### MoveBack
Move the agent backward by `gridSize` (without changing view direction).
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveBack'))
```
#### Teleport 
Move the agent to any location in the scene (within scene bounds). Using this command it is possible to put the agent into places that would not normally be possible to navigate to, but it can be useful if you need to place an agent in the exact same spot for a task.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='Teleport', x=0.999, y=1.01, z=-0.3541))
``` 
#### Get Reachable Positions
Returns valid coordinates that the Agent can reach without colliding with the environment or Sim Objects. This can be used in tandem with `Teleport` to warp the Agent as needed. This is useful for things like randomizing the initial position of the agent without clipping into the environment.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='GetReachablePositions'))
``` 

### Sim Object Interaction
Check [The Sim Object Info Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wx8vWgmFSi-4Gknkwl2fUMG8oRedu-tUklGSvU0oh4U/edit?usp=sharing) and open the **Object Interactions** sheet for an info table on what Sim Object types can be interacted with in which ways.

#### Pickup Object

Pick up an Interactable object specified by `objectID` and move it to the Agent's Hand. Note that the agent's hand must be clear of obstruction- if the target object being in the Agent's Hand would cause it to clip into the environment, this will fail.

Picked up objects can also obstruct the Agent's view of the environment since the Agent's hand is always in camera view, so know that picking up larger objects will obstruct the field of vision.

**Moveable Receptacles:** Note that certain objects are Receptacles that can themselves be picked up. If a moveable receptacle is picked up while other Sim Objects are inside of it, the contained objects will be picked up with the moveable receptacle. This allows for sequences like "Place Egg on Plate -> Pick Up Plate" to move both the Plate and Egg.

```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='PickupObject', objectId="Mug|0.25|-0.27"))
```
#### Put Object
A Sim Object in the Agent's hand (`objectId`), will be put in/on a target receptacle specified by `receptacleObjectID`. 

**Receptacle Restrictions:** By default, objects are restricted as to what type of receptacle they can be placed in. Please refer to [the Sim Object Info Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wx8vWgmFSi-4Gknkwl2fUMG8oRedu-tUklGSvU0oh4U/edit?usp=sharing), check the **_"Pickupable Object Restrictions"_** sheet, and use the dropdown menu under **_"Select Object Type"_** to see which object types can validly be placed in which receptacle types. 

If `forceAction = true` is passed in to this command, object placement will ignore the beforementioned placement restrictions.

Additionally, there are 2 "modes" that can be used when placing an object:

**Physics Mode: Non-determanistic final position**
If `placeStationary = false` is passed in, a placed object will use the physics engine to resolve the final position. This means placing an object on an uneven surface may cause inconsistent results due to the object rolling around or even falling off of the target receptacle. Note that because of variances in physics resolution, this placement mode is non-determanistic!

**Stationary Mode: Determanistic final position**
This is the default value of `placeStationary` if no parameter is passed in. If `placeStationary = true`, the object will be placed in/on the valid receptacle without using physics to resolve the final position. This means that the object will be placed so that it will not roll around. For determanistic placement make sure to use this mode!

Place the Tomato in the TableTop receptacle.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='PutObject', objectId = "Tomato|0.1|3.2|0.43", receptacleObjectId = "TableTop|0.25|-0.27|0.95"))
 ```
 
#### Drop Object
Drop a held object and let Physics resolve where it lands. Note that this is different from the "Place Object" function, as this does not guarantee the held object will be put into a specified receptacle. This is meant to be used in tandem with the Move/Rotate Hand functions to maneuver a held object to a target area, and the let it drop.

Additionally, this Drop action will fail if the held object is not clear from all collisions. Most importantly, the Agent's collision will prevent Drop, as dropping an object if it is "inside" the agent will lead to unintended behavior.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='DropHandObject')))
```
#### Throw Object
Throw a held object in the current forward direction of the Agent at a force specified by `moveMagnitude`. Because objects can have different Mass properties, certain objects will require more or less force to push the same distance. 
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='ThrowObject', moveMagnitude= 150 )))
```
#### OpenObject 
Open an object specified by `objectID`. 

If a `moveMagnitude` value is passed in as well, it can be used to open an object a percentage of its full "open" position. To do this, pass a value between 0 and 1 (1 being fully open). The second example here would open the Fridge halfway.

The target object must be within range of the Agent and Interactable in order for this action to succeed. An object can fail to open if it hits another object as it is opening. In this case the action will fail and the target object will reset to the position it was last in.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='OpenObject', objectId="Fridge|0.25|0.75"))
event = controller.step(dict(action='OpenObject', objectId="Fridge|0.25|0.75", moveMagnitude = 0.5))
```
#### CloseObject
Close an object specified by `objectID`.

The target object must be within range of the Agent and Interactable in order for this action to succeed. An object can fail to open if it hits another object as it is closing. In this case the action will fail and the target object will reset to the position it was last in.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='CloseObject', objectId="Fridge|0.25|0.75"))
```

#### Toggle On
Toggles an object specified by `objectID` into the On state if applicable. Noteable examples are Lamps, Light Switches, and Laptops.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='ToggleObjectOn', objectId= "LightSwitch|0.25|-0.27|0.95")))
```
#### Toggle Off
Toggles an object specified by `objectID` into the Off state if applicable. Noteable examples are Lamps, Light Switches, and Laptops.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='ToggleObjectOff', objectId= "LightSwitch|0.25|-0.27|0.95")))
```

### Agent Hand/Object Manipulation
If the agent has picked up an object, it can manipulate the position and rotation of the Hand and the object held. The position of the Agent's hand is constrained by the Camera viewport and cannot be moved outside of the viewport.

#### Move Hand Forward
Moves the hand forward relative to the agent's current facing the given moveMagnitude in meters.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveHandAhead', moveMagnitude = 0.1))
```
#### Move Hand Back
Moves the hand back relative to the agent's current facing the given moveMagnitude in meters.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveHandBack', moveMagnitude = 0.1))
```
#### Move Hand Left
Moves the hand left relative to the agent's current facing the given moveMagnitude in meters.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveHandLeft', moveMagnitude = 0.1))
```
#### Move Hand Right
Moves the hand right relative to the agent's current facing the given moveMagnitude in meters.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveHandRight', moveMagnitude = 0.1))
```
#### Move Hand Up
Moves the hand up relative to the agent's current facing the given moveMagnitude in meters.
```python
event =controller.step(dict(action='MoveHandUp', moveMagnitude = 0.1))
```
#### Move Hand Down
Moves the hand down relative to the agent's current facing the given moveMagnitude in meters.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='MoveHandDown', moveMagnitude = 0.1))
```
#### Rotate Hand
Rotates the hand and held object about the specified axes (x, y, z) the specified number of degrees. These examples rotate a held object 90 degrees about the each axis. 
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='RotateHand', x = 90))
event = controller.step(dict(action='RotateHand', y = 90))
event = controller.step(dict(action='RotateHand', z = 90))
```
Multiple Axes can be specified at once as well.
```python
event = controller.step(dict(action='RotateHand', x = 90, y = 15, z = 28))
```

## Architecture

AI2-THOR is made up of two components: a set of scenes built for the Unity game engine located in ```unity``` folder, a lightweight Python API that interacts with the game engine located in ```ai2thor``` folder.

On the Python side there is a Flask service that listens for HTTP requests from the Unity game engine. After an action is executed within the game engine, a screen capture is taken and a JSON metadata object is constructed from the state of all the objects of the scene and POST'd to the Python Flask service.  This payload is then used to construct an Event object comprised of a numpy array (the screen capture) and metadata (dictionary containing the current state of every object including the agent).  At this point the game engine waits for a response from the Python service, which it receives when the next ```controller.step()``` call is made.  Once the response is received within Unity, the requested action is taken and the process repeats.


## Unity Development

If you wish to make changes to the Unity scenes/assets you will need to install Unity Editor version 2018.3.6 for OSX (Linux Editor is currently in Beta) from [Unity Download Archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).  After making your desired changes using the Unity Editor you will need to build.  To do this you must first exit the editor, then run the following commands from the ai2thor base directory. Individual scenes (the 3D models) can be found beneath the unity/Assets/Scenes directory - scenes are named FloorPlan###.

```python
pip install invoke
invoke local-build
```

This will create a build beneath the directory 'unity/builds/local-build/thor-local-OSXIntel64.app'. To use this build in your code, make the following change:

```python
controller = ai2thor.controller.Controller()
controller.local_executable_path = "<BASE_DIR>/unity/builds/local-build/thor-local-OSXIntel64.app/Contents/MacOS/thor-local-OSXIntel64"
controller.start()
```
